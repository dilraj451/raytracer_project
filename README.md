# Raytracer

## Purpose
To create a raytracer by simulating the refractive effects of different lenses such that light-ray experiments can be simulated.

## List of python files included
'raytracer.py' (module), 'opticalelements.py' (module), 'test_space.py' (script), 'model_testing.py' (script), raytracing_experiments.py' (script), 'plano_convex.py' (script), 'convex_plano.py' (script), 'lens_comparison.py' (script).

## Description
Object-Orientated Programming was used to define new classes to represent light rays and variety of different lenses and their effects on the light rays, defined respectively in 'raytracer.py' and 'opticalelements.py'. Numerous python scripts contain raytracing simulations using different lenses.

# User instructions
Execute 'raytracing_experiments.py' to view the refraction by a spehrical lens. The lens, scree, or their parameters can be changed by changing the methods or parameters in lines 21 and 22.
